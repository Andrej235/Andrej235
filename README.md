# Hi, I'm Andrej ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack web developer with a love for backend systems, clean architecture, and the occasional deep dive into strange tech.
Most of my work revolves around **C#/.NET**, and **Next.js**, but I also enjoy experimenting with some other, more 'exotic' languages, and building tools that speed up development.

I believe in learning by building, breaking things to understand them, and sharing progress along the way.
